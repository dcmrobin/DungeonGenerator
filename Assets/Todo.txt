when you glitch out of the map, you get transported to a backrooms level or something... make loads of backrooms stuff

add notes around the map that once you press them they go away and then a file gets added to your computer that is a bit of lore
    lore idea:
        the maze you're in was at the start the backrooms but was remodeled into a fun place for people to go to have a sort of laser tag battle and the dead ends you encounter are actually just walls to seperate you from the rest of the backrooms.

this game needs sound


bugs:

player has to press quick join lobby twice because of lag issues

players can't ride the lift upwards together... but there's a failsafe so don't worry about it
