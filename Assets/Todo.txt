vents that lead to other vents maybe

the other players need to be able to see each other's markers on the map

add things like hazards around the levels and/or enemies



(oh and also maybe add an easter egg where there's an insanely small chance that a portal will spawn instead of a door and teleport the player to somewhere cool)
