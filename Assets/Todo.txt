add notes around the map that once you press them they go away and then a file gets added to your computer that is a bit of lore
    lore idea:
        the maze you're in was at the start the backrooms but was remodeled into a fun place for people to go to have a sort of laser tag battle and the dead ends you encounter are actually just walls to seperate you from the rest of the backrooms.

this game needs sound

Curiosity Enlightened The Cat (CETC) Co. is a bit sketchy

have multiple weapons maybe? Instead of having a gun at first, you have to find a weapon in the maze itself and pick it up. Then when it runs out of ammo, you have to get a new one.


bugs:

player has to press quick join lobby twice because of lag issues

players can't ride the lift upwards together... but there's a failsafe so don't worry about it

when a segment overlaps, it deletes itself but still decreases the worldsize number. this is leading to worlds that are smaller than the worldsize.
