vents that lead to other vents maybe

the other players need to be able to see each other's markers on the map

add things like hazards around the levels and/or enemies


(oh and also maybe add an easter egg where there's an insanely small chance that a portal will spawn instead of a door and teleport the player to somewhere cool)




bugs:
doors aren't syncing probably due to none of the segments being able to networkobject.spawn for some reason
but maybe spawning the doors seperately might fix this.

player has to press quick join lobby twice because of lag issues
